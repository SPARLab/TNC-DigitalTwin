# complete-dev-task

Please create a commit message, and if you haven't already, document your progress
by modifying whatever development tracker markdown file we're working with.
You're probably going to need to mark the current task off in the development-task-tracker.md 
and for the current task, you're going to need to edit the master-design.md and also any relevant
phase documents.
And, if necessary, write any needed documentation.

Write your command content here.

This command will be available in chat with /complete-dev-task
