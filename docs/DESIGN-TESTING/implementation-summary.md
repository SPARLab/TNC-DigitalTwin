# Implementation Summary: Count Display Testing Feature

**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Task:** Create a dropdown switcher to test different result count display options in Map Layers widget  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and working  
**Estimated Implementation Time:** ~1.5 hours

---

## What Was Built

A temporary design-testing feature that allows switching between 6 different count display modes in the Map Layers widget:

1. **No Counts** — Hide all counts
2. **Filter Count Only** — Current behavior (show filter count)
3. **Result Count (Collapsed)** — Show result count in collapsed row
4. **Result Count (Expanded)** — Show result count in expanded panel only
5. **Result Count (Children)** — Show result count on child views only
6. **Both (Test)** — Show both filter and result counts (comparison mode)

---

## How It Works

### User Experience

1. User clicks the gear/settings icon (⚙) in the Map Layers widget header
2. A dropdown menu appears with 6 mode options
3. User selects a mode
4. The widget immediately updates to show counts according to that mode
5. User can switch modes in real-time to compare

### Technical Architecture

```
MapLayersWidget
  ├─ useState<CountDisplayMode>('filters-only')
  ├─ CountDisplayDropdown (settings icon in header)
  │   └─ Dropdown menu with 6 options
  └─ PinnedLayersSection (receives countDisplayMode prop)
      └─ PinnedLayerRow (receives countDisplayMode prop)
          ├─ Conditional rendering based on mode
          └─ PinnedLayerChildRow (receives countDisplayMode prop)
              └─ Conditional rendering based on mode
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/v2/types/index.ts`**
   - Added `CountDisplayMode` type (6 options)
   - Added `resultCount?: number` to `PinnedLayer` interface
   - Added `resultCount?: number` to `PinnedLayerView` interface

2. **`src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/shared/WidgetHeader.tsx`**
   - Added `customActions?: ReactNode` prop
   - Allows injecting custom buttons/dropdowns into header

3. **`src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/MapLayersWidget.tsx`**
   - Added `countDisplayMode` state (default: 'filters-only')
   - Added `CountDisplayDropdown` to header's `customActions`
   - Passed `countDisplayMode` down to `PinnedLayersSection`

4. **`src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayersSection.tsx`**
   - Added `countDisplayMode: CountDisplayMode` prop
   - Passed mode down to each `PinnedLayerRow`

5. **`src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayerRow.tsx`**
   - Added `countDisplayMode: CountDisplayMode` prop
   - Added conditional rendering logic for filter/result counts
   - Shows counts in collapsed row or expanded panel based on mode
   - Passes mode to child rows

6. **`src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`**
   - Added `countDisplayMode: CountDisplayMode` prop
   - Added conditional rendering logic for filter/result counts
   - Shows counts based on mode (children-specific logic)

7. **`src/v2/context/LayerContext.tsx`**
   - Added mock `resultCount` values to `INITIAL_PINNED` data
   - Camera Traps → mountain lion: 47 results
   - Camera Traps → deer: 128 results
   - iNaturalist: 342 results
   - Fire Perimeters: 8 results
   - Water Sensors: 12 results

## Code Stats

- **Lines added:** ~350
- **Files created:** 3
- **Files modified:** 7

## Testing Status

✅ **TypeScript:** No type errors  
✅ **Linter:** No linter errors  
✅ **Dev Server:** Running and hot-reloading successfully  
✅ **Mock Data:** Result counts visible in all modes  
⏳ **User Testing:** Ready for stakeholder feedback

## How to Test

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5180/?v2`
2. Look at the Map Layers widget (top-left floating widget)
3. Click the gear icon (⚙) in the widget header
4. Select different modes and observe:
   - **Mode 1 (None):** All counts disappear
   - **Mode 2 (Filters Only):** Filter icons with count (🔽 3)
   - **Mode 3 (Results Collapsed):** "47 results" text next to layer name
   - **Mode 4 (Results Expanded):** Count appears when you expand a row
   - **Mode 5 (Results Children):** Counts only on nested child rows
   - **Mode 6 (Both):** Both filter icon and result count side-by-side

5. Test with nested layers (Camera Traps) to see child view counts
6. Test space constraints by observing long layer names with counts

## Design Decisions to Make

Based on this testing tool, the team needs to decide:

1. **Should we show result counts?** (vs just filter counts)
2. **Where should counts appear?** (collapsed, expanded, or both)
3. **What about nested layers?** (parent, children, or both)
4. **Is space an issue?** (do counts cause layout problems?)
5. **Filter count vs result count:** Which is more valuable?

---

## Next Steps

1. **User testing** with Amy, Trisalyn, Dan (before Feb 20)
2. **Gather feedback** on which mode is most useful
3. **Make decision** on final implementation
4. **Clean up code:**
   - Remove `CountDisplayDropdown` component
   - Remove `countDisplayMode` state/props
   - Implement chosen approach directly
   - Remove unused conditional logic
5. **Update documentation** with design rationale

---

## Removal Instructions

When a decision is made, here's how to clean up:

1. **Delete** `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/shared/CountDisplayDropdown.tsx`
2. **Remove** `countDisplayMode` state from `MapLayersWidget.tsx`
3. **Remove** `CountDisplayMode` import and prop threading
4. **Simplify** conditional rendering in `PinnedLayerRow.tsx` and `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`
5. **Keep** `resultCount` fields in types (these will be used in final implementation)
6. **Keep** mock result counts in `LayerContext.tsx` (or replace with real data)
7. **Archive** design-testing docs to `docs/DESIGN-TESTING/archive/`

---

## Lessons Learned

- ✅ **Props threading** through 5 levels is manageable for testing but could be simplified with Context
- ✅ **Conditional rendering** is clean when centralized in leaf components
- ✅ **Mock data** is essential for design testing before backend integration
- ✅ **Visual documentation** (ASCII mockups) speeds up stakeholder discussions
- ✅ **Temporary features** are valuable for rapid design iteration
