# Design Feedback & Issue Tracker

**Purpose:** Track UI/UX feedback, design decisions, and implementation concerns for **v2.0** as discrete issues. This document serves as a staging area before development plans are finalized.

**Scope:** This tracker is focused on v2.0 design decisions. Features deferred to future versions (v2.1+) are tracked in `PLANNING/future-enhancements.md`.

**How to use this doc:**
1. New feedback gets logged as a numbered issue
2. Discuss/iterate in the issue's "Discussion" section
3. Mark resolved once a decision is made
4. Resolved issues feed into development plans
5. **When resolving an issue:** Update `master-development-plan.md` and relevant phase documents with the decision

**For AI Agents:** When you mark a feedback item as resolved with a decision/outcome:
- Document the decision in the issue's "Resolution" section
- Update `docs/master-plan.md` if it affects cross-phase decisions
- **CRITICAL:** Update relevant phase documents in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION/phases/` if it affects specific implementation
  - Update ASCII diagrams to match the decision
  - Update acceptance criteria if needed
  - Add decision notes at the top of relevant task sections
- Add an entry to "Cross-Phase Decisions" in master plan if the decision impacts multiple phases
- **DO NOT automatically archive resolved items** — Only archive to `PLANNING/resolved-decisions/` when explicitly requested by the user. The user may request archiving to keep this document manageable as it grows.

**For Processing Meeting Transcripts:**
- Store raw transcripts in `PLANNING/feedback/transcripts/`
- Process transcripts and create structured documents in `PLANNING/feedback/ai-derived-tasks-from-transcripts/`
- Extract DFT-XXX items from processed documents and add to this tracker

**Design Decision Sync Process:**
- When a design decision is made in this tracker (DFT-XXX resolved), ensure the ASCII diagrams and specs in `IMPLEMENTATION/phases/` match exactly
- Phase documents are the **canonical source** for implementation specs
- This tracker documents the **decision rationale** and **discussion process**
- If diagrams differ, phase document takes precedence (it's what developers will reference)

**📋 When Resolving a DFT-XXX Item — Update Checklist:**

When marking a DFT-XXX item as resolved, verify/update ALL of the following:

1. **Phase Documents (`IMPLEMENTATION/phases/`):**
   - [ ] Find all affected phase tasks (e.g., if widget design changes, check `phase-0-foundation.md` task 0.5)
   - [ ] Update ASCII diagrams to match the decision exactly
   - [ ] Update acceptance criteria if behavior changes
   - [ ] Add decision note at top of relevant task section (format: `**Decision (Date):** Resolved DFT-XXX — [summary]`)

2. **Master Plan (`master-plan.md`):**
   - [ ] Add entry to "Cross-Phase Decisions" → "UX Decisions" table if decision affects multiple phases
   - [ ] Update changelog with resolution date and summary

3. **Resolved Decisions (`PLANNING/resolved-decisions/`):**
   - [ ] Create summary document `dft-XXX-resolution-summary.md` if decision is significant enough to archive
   - [ ] Include: decision date, rationale, design decisions, ASCII diagrams, verification checklist

4. **This Tracker (`planning-task-tracker.md`):**
   - [ ] Update status to 🟢 Resolved
   - [ ] Fill in "Resolution" section with decision summary
   - [ ] Add "Documented in:" section listing all places updated
   - [ ] Add "✅ Verification Checklist" showing what was checked

5. **Mockups (if applicable):**
   - [ ] Note if mockups need updating (e.g., "Mockup 02c needs update to reflect new button logic")
   - [ ] Update mockup files if decision significantly changes UI

**Common Locations to Check:**
- **Widget designs:** `IMPLEMENTATION/phases/phase-0-foundation.md` task 0.5 (Pinned Layers Widget)
- **Left sidebar:** `IMPLEMENTATION/phases/phase-0-foundation.md` task 0.2 (Left Sidebar)
- **Right sidebar:** Various phase documents depending on data source
- **Export functionality:** `IMPLEMENTATION/phases/phase-5-export-builder.md`
- **Cross-phase decisions:** `master-plan.md` → "Cross-Phase Decisions" → "UX Decisions"

**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026 (Archived DFT-001 through DFT-027 to reduce tracker size)

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] **BEFORE MOCKUPS (DFT-037):** Resolve all design discussion tasks (DFT-015 through DFT-036)
  - **High priority:** ~~DFT-018 (loading states)~~, ~~DFT-020 (pointer-row bookmark UI)~~, DFT-030 (error states)
  - **Medium priority:** ~~DFT-019 (Edit Filters navigation)~~, ~~DFT-024 (Filter indicator)~~, DFT-028, DFT-029, DFT-031, DFT-032, DFT-035
  - **Low priority:** Can defer to Phase 6 if not blocking mockup generation
- [x] **Archive completed:** Archived DFT-001 through DFT-027 to `PLANNING/archived-planning-tasks-from-tracker.md` (Feb 4, 2026)

### DFT-028: Zero-Result Camera Behavior

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026 (extracted from DFT-012 edge cases)

**Context:**
Per DFT-012, when a species filter is applied (e.g., "mountain lion"), cameras show badges with counts. 

**Edge case:** What happens to cameras with 0 matching images?

**Options:**
1. **Hide cameras with 0 matches** — cleaner map, shows only relevant locations
2. **Show grayed out** — maintains spatial context, shows where species is NOT present
3. **Show with "0" badge** — explicit count, but clutters map
4. **User preference** — toggle to "show all cameras" or "show matching only"

**Considerations:**
- Hiding may cause confusion ("where did CAM-042 go?")
- Graying out maintains mental map of all camera locations
- Showing "0" badges adds noise but is explicit

**Discussion:**
*Needs decision — affects ANiML visualization*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

---

### DFT-029: Unfiltered Layer Badge Behavior

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026 (extracted from DFT-012 edge cases)

**Context:**
Per DFT-012, badges appear on camera icons showing filtered image counts. Badges only appear when a layer-level filter is applied.

**Question:** What happens when NO filter is applied? Should cameras show total image counts, or no badges at all?

**Options:**
1. **No badges until filter applied** — cleaner default, badges indicate active query
2. **Always show total counts** — useful overview, but may clutter map
3. **Show totals on hover only** — clean map, details on demand
4. **User preference** — toggle for "show image counts"

**Considerations:**
- Showing totals may overwhelm with numbers if 50+ cameras
- No badges until filter is cleaner but loses "overview" capability
- Hover-only is a middle ground but requires interaction

**Discussion:**
*Needs decision — affects ANiML default state*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

---

### DFT-030: Error State Design

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
No design specification for error handling:
- API request fails (network error, timeout, 500 error)
- Partial data load failure (some cameras load, others fail)
- Authentication/permission errors
- Rate limiting errors

**Why this matters (Nielsen: Help users recognize, diagnose, recover from errors):**
Errors are inevitable. Users need clear feedback about what went wrong and how to recover.

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. Where do error messages appear? (Toast? Inline? Modal?)
2. Should errors include retry buttons?
3. How long do error toasts persist?
4. What's the error message tone? (Technical? Friendly?)
5. Should errors be logged for debugging?

**Options:**
1. **Toast notifications** — non-blocking, auto-dismiss after 5-10 seconds
2. **Inline errors** — appear in the component that failed (e.g., "Failed to load cameras")
3. **Error modal** — for critical errors that prevent app function
4. **Combination** — inline for component errors, toast for background errors

**Discussion:**
*High priority — affects user trust and recovery*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

### DFT-031: Confirmation Dialogs Pattern

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
Some actions may warrant confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental data loss:
- Unpinning a layer with filters (loses filter state)
- Clearing all filters on a pinned layer
- Removing a bookmark
- Deleting a filtered view

**Question:** Which actions require explicit confirmation, and which can be undone via undo/redo?

**Options:**
1. **No confirmations, rely on undo** — faster workflow, less friction
2. **Confirm destructive actions** — unpin with filters, delete view
3. **Confirm all removes** — any ✕ button shows "Are you sure?"
4. **Soft delete + toast with undo** — action happens immediately, toast shows "Undo" for 5 seconds

**Considerations:**
- Too many confirmations = friction and "confirmation fatigue"
- Too few = anxiety about accidental clicks
- Undo is generally preferred over confirmation (less disruptive)

**Discussion:**
*Needs decision — affects interaction patterns*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

---

### DFT-032: Map Tooltip Design

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
When users hover over features on the map (cameras, sensors, observations), what information appears in the tooltip before they click?

**Why this matters (Nielsen: Visibility of system status / Shneiderman: Overview first, details on demand):**
Tooltips provide "information scent" — users can preview what they'll get by clicking, reducing uncertainty and wasted clicks.

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. What fields appear in each data source's tooltip?
2. Should tooltips show filter-relevant info (e.g., "23 mountain lion images" on camera)?
3. How long before tooltip appears? (instant? 200ms delay?)
4. Does tooltip persist on hover, or dismiss after a timeout?
5. Are tooltips accessible via keyboard (focus state)?

**Options by Data Source:**
- **ANiML Camera:** Camera ID, location, image count (filtered if filter active)
- **Dendra Sensor:** Sensor ID, type, date range, latest reading
- **iNaturalist:** Species, date, observer
- **DataOne Dataset:** Title, date, source

**Discussion:**
*Needs specification for each data source*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

### DFT-033: Right Sidebar Width and Resizability

**Category:** Layout  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Low  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
What is the right sidebar's width, and can users resize it?

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. Fixed width or resizable?
2. If fixed, what width? (320px? 400px? 480px?)
3. If resizable, what are min/max widths?
4. Should width persist across sessions?
5. Does the sidebar have a collapse/expand toggle?

**Options:**
1. **Fixed width (400px)** — consistent, simpler implementation
2. **Resizable with drag handle** — flexible, accommodates different content needs
3. **Breakpoint-based** — wider on larger screens, narrower on smaller
4. **Collapsible** — full collapse to maximize map, expand when needed

**Considerations:**
- Image grids (ANiML) benefit from wider sidebar
- Time-series charts (Dendra) benefit from wider sidebar
- Text metadata (iNaturalist) works fine with narrower sidebar
- Map needs to remain usable with sidebar open

**Discussion:**
*Low priority but affects layout*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

### DFT-034: Drag-and-Drop Reorder Feedback

**Category:** Microinteraction  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Low  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
Per Phase 0, pinned layers have drag handles for reordering. What visual feedback appears during drag?

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. What cursor appears when hovering drag handle? (grab cursor)
2. What happens to the row being dragged? (lifted, semi-transparent, ghost)
3. How is the drop target indicated? (line, highlighted gap, placeholder)
4. What animation plays when dropped?
5. Does drag reorder affect map layer z-order?

**Options:**
1. **Lifted row + drop line** — row lifts visually, line shows where it will land
2. **Ghost placeholder** — ghost of row follows cursor, placeholder in list
3. **Swap animation** — adjacent rows move aside as you drag past them
4. **Minimal** — just cursor change, row moves on drop (no animation)

**Considerations:**
- This is a polish item, not critical for MVP
- ArcGIS/Esri patterns may provide precedent

**Discussion:**
*Low priority — can defer to Phase 6*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

---

### DFT-035: DataOne Search Behavior

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
DataOne has a search interface. How should search behave?

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. Instant search (as you type) or explicit submit (press Enter/button)?
2. If instant, what debounce delay? (300ms? 500ms?)
3. Should search include all fields or specific fields (title, author, keywords)?
4. How are search results paginated?
5. What happens on empty search (show all? show recent? show placeholder)?

**Options:**
1. **Instant search with debounce** — responsive, modern feel
2. **Explicit submit** — more control, less API load
3. **Hybrid** — instant for 3+ characters, explicit for fewer

**Considerations:**
- DataOne API may have rate limits
- Large result sets need pagination or virtualization
- Empty search could be overwhelming (many datasets)

**Discussion:**
*Needs input from Dan on API constraints*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

### DFT-036: Feature Highlight on Bookmark Hover

**Category:** UI/UX  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** Low  
**Source:** UX Design Review, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
When user hovers over a bookmarked feature in the Bookmarked Features widget, should the corresponding feature highlight on the map?

**Why this matters (Gestalt: Common fate / Nielsen: Recognition over recall):**
Highlighting creates a visual link between widget row and map feature, helping users understand the relationship without clicking.

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. Does hovering a bookmark row highlight the feature on the map?
2. What does "highlight" look like? (pulse, ring, color change, zoom to?)
3. Does this work for features not currently visible on the map?
4. Should it scroll the map to show the feature?
5. Does hovering a pinned layer row highlight all its features?

**Options:**
1. **Highlight only** — feature pulses/rings but map doesn't move
2. **Highlight + pan** — map pans to show feature if off-screen
3. **No hover interaction** — click required to see feature
4. **Bidirectional** — hovering map feature highlights widget row too

**Considerations:**
- Could be distracting if many bookmarks
- Pan-on-hover may feel disorienting
- May conflict with map's own hover behavior

**Discussion:**
*Low priority polish item*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

### DFT-037: Generate Updated Mockups After Design Decisions Resolved

**Category:** Task  
**Status:** 🟡 Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Source:** Will, Feb 3, 2026

**Context:**
Mockups should NOT be generated until all design discussion tasks (DFT-015 through DFT-036) are resolved. Once resolved, updated mockups need to be created that reflect all design decisions from DFT-001 through DFT-036 (excluding any decisions that were explicitly omitted or deferred).

**Prerequisites:**
- All high-priority design issues resolved (DFT-015, DFT-018, DFT-020, DFT-030)
- All medium-priority design issues resolved (or explicitly deferred)
- All resolved decisions documented in phase documents and master plan

**Task:**
Generate updated mockups (`mockups/02a-02f` or new versions) that demonstrate:
- All resolved UX decisions from DFT-001 through DFT-036
- Empty states (per DFT-015)
- Loading states (per DFT-018)
- Error states (per DFT-030)
- All widget designs with final specifications
- All sidebar designs with final specifications
- All interaction patterns as resolved

**Exclusions:**
- Any DFT decisions explicitly omitted or deferred to v2.1+
- Decisions marked as "defer to Phase 6" unless they affect mockup generation

**Post-Completion:**
After DFT-037 is complete, **archive resolved design decisions** to `PLANNING/resolved-decisions/` to keep `planning-task-tracker.md` manageable. The tracker should focus on open issues, not serve as a historical archive.

**Discussion:**
*Blocked until DFT-015 through DFT-036 are resolved*

**Resolution:** *Pending*

### DFT-002: Export Button Placement/Visibility ✅

**Resolved:** Jan 29, 2026  
**Source:** Sophia Leiker, Jan 23, 2026

**Decision:** **Shopping cart button in global header (top-right corner)**

**Key Design Elements:**
- **Placement:** Top-right corner of global header, equidistant from both floating widgets
- **Visual design:** Shopping cart icon (🛒) with "Export All" label
- **Badge indicator:** Red circle showing total count (pinned layers + bookmarked features)
- **Accent color:** Yellow/orange to make it pop and feel distinct from other UI elements
- **Action:** Opens unified Export Builder modal showing both pinned layers and bookmarked features
- **Rationale:**
  - Follows universal shopping cart convention (top-right = "saved items basket")
  - Global header placement = global action (not tied to single layer or widget)
  - Equidistant from both widgets → doesn't favor one over the other
  - Avoids Law of Proximity violation (not in right sidebar which implies single-layer scope)

**Impact:**
- Phase 0 task 0.1 updated with header button requirement
- Phase 5 task 5.1 updated: modal opens from global header (not bookmark widget)
- Master plan updated with cross-phase UX decision

## Resolved Issues

### DFT-001: Pin vs. Toggle Visibility Behavior ✅

**Resolved:** Jan 27, 2026  
**Source:** Sophia Leiker, Jan 23, 2026

**Decision:** **Model C adopted** — Selection-based active layer, separate pin action.

**Key Design Elements:**
- **Left sidebar:** Only shows selection indicator (●), no eyeball/pin icons
- **Widget sections:** "Active Layer" (single-select) + "Pinned Layers" (multi-select)
- **Behavior:** Click layer → active/visible. Click [📌] → pins it. Toggle 👁 → hide/show without unpinning.
- **Filter indicators:** Funnel emoji (🌪️) + count inline (e.g., `🌪️5`)
- **Distinguishers:** Parenthetical auto-generated from primary filter (e.g., `Camera Traps (mt. lion)`)
- **A/B testing:** Debug toggle to compare text vs icon filter representations

**Impact:** 
- Phase 0 tasks 0.2 and 0.5 updated with refined designs
- Supports DFT-013 (multiple filtered views) via unique distinguishers
- Clean UI with reduced cognitive load

### DFT-010: Terminology — "Items" → "Features" ✅

**Resolved:** Jan 26, 2026  
**Source:** Trisalyn Nelson

**Decision:** "Features is a word that is more familiar to the GIS user." Applied "items → features" terminology throughout.

**Impact:** Updated all development plan documents with new terminology.

---

### DFT-011: Target Audience Clarification ✅

**Resolved:** Jan 26, 2026  
**Source:** Trisalyn Nelson

**Decision:** Primary audience is **researchers** (academic, TNC staff), with particular attention to GIS-minded users. NOT targeting broad public.

**Impact:** Can use GIS terminology (features, layers, queries) without over-simplification.

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| Feb 3, 2026 | **UX Design Review:** Added DFT-015 through DFT-037 (23 new issues). DFT-015 through DFT-036 cover empty states, responsiveness, accessibility, loading states, navigation behavior, terminology consistency, edge cases, visual specs, microinteractions, and interaction patterns. DFT-037 is the mockup generation task (blocked until design decisions resolved). **High-priority:** DFT-015 (empty states), DFT-018 (loading states), DFT-020 (pointer-row bookmark UI), DFT-030 (error states), DFT-037 (mockup generation). **Note:** After DFT-037, archive resolved decisions to keep tracker manageable |

| Jan 26, 2026 | Resolved DFT-010: Applied "items" → "features" terminology to dev plan docs |
| Jan 26, 2026 | Added Discussion Items table and Team Context section |
| Jan 26, 2026 | Updated DFT-006 with Will's recommendation (Overview first with Browse button) |
| Jan 27, 2026 | Resolved DFT-001: Adopted Model C (selection = active, pin separate) with filter indicators |
| Jan 29, 2026 | Resolved DFT-002: Export button moves to global header (top-right) with shopping cart design |
| Jan 29, 2026 | Resolved DFT-005: Auto-collapse Pinned Layers widget when viewing time-series data |
| Feb 2, 2026 | Resolved DFT-003b: "Create New View" lives in expanded panel when layer is active (Option C) |
| Feb 2, 2026 | Resolved DFT-003c: Landing cards approach for Animal-First/Camera-First entry point |
| Feb 2, 2026 | Resolved DFT-004: Progressive disclosure + direct/parametric separation. Sidebar edits filters (context-aware), pop-up has slider only (exploration), widget shows status |
| Feb 2, 2026 | Resolved DFT-006: Overview tab opens first when layer selected, with prominent "Browse Features →" button |
| Feb 2, 2026 | Resolved DFT-007: Bookmark widget groups features by parent layer; layer header is non-interactive context label using muted styling |
| Feb 3, 2026 | Resolved DFT-012: Camera trap clustering — count badges on camera icons showing filtered image counts. Badges appear when layer-level filter is applied. Progressive disclosure integration confirmed |
| Feb 3, 2026 | Resolved DFT-013: Multiple filtered views — "Multiple Saved, Single Visible" model. Users can save multiple filtered views but only one is visible at a time (mutual exclusivity). Nested widget structure when 2+ views exist. Memory-preserving parent toggle. Future enhancement could allow limited simultaneous views |
| Feb 3, 2026 | Created `PLANNING/future-enhancements.md` backlog for v2.1+ features. Moved DFT-014 (biodiversity aggregation) to backlog. Updated tracker scope to clarify it's focused on v2.0 design decisions |
| Feb 3, 2026 | Resolved DFT-015: Empty state design — show with placeholder, differentiate first-visit (educational) vs returning (laconic). Configurable terminology via `src/config/terminology.ts` ("Feature" vs "Item"). Widget titles use pattern: "Pinned {childNoun} Layers" / "Bookmarked {childNoun}s". Utilitarian tone, simple SVG icons (no emoji). Drone/LiDAR confirmed as pin-only (no bookmarkable items) |
| Feb 3, 2026 | Resolved DFT-018: Loading states — hybrid indicators (skeleton for content, spinner for actions, progress bar for ANiML queries). Region-specific/non-blocking/escapable. Dynamic ETA for multi-query operations. Progressive image loading with infinite scroll. Timeout thresholds: 0-300ms none, 300ms-3s spinner, 3s-15s +text, 15s+ warning, 30s auto-timeout. Added to `DESIGN-SYSTEM/design-system.md` |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Resolved DFT-019: Edit Filters button navigation — "Edit Filters →" label with arrow, widget stays expanded, right sidebar uses 150-200ms crossfade transitions. Separation of concerns: widget manages visibility, sidebar manages editing |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Resolved DFT-020: Pointer-row bookmark UI — single button pattern ("Bookmark" always captures current filter state). Removed "Bookmark with Filter" variant to reduce cognitive load |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Resolved DFT-021: Terminology consistency — "Active" layer (visible on map) vs "Selected" layer (chosen for editing). Applied throughout docs |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Deferred DFT-022: Parent toggle memory edge case — runtime state management question best solved during implementation |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Deferred DFT-023: Widget positioning dimensions — exact pixel values deferred to mockup/implementation phase with constraints (8px grid, ArcGIS reference, adaptive height, DFT-019 animation standards, left-aligned collapse button for accessibility) |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Resolved DFT-024: Filter indicator design — icon-based approach (Lucide Filter icon + count). Single-line rows, tooltip for learnability. Removed A/B testing toggle |
| Feb 4, 2026 | Resolved DFT-025: Create New View transition animation — inline transformation with sequential staging (250-300ms). Row expands → children appear → new child highlights. Respects reduced motion. Focus moves to new child. Screen reader announces state change |
