## How to Archive a Completed Task

1. Open the phase archive file (e.g. `phase-2-animl-completed.md`)
2. Add a row to the Task Summary table: `| ID | ✅ | YYYY-MM-DD | Description | Notes |`
3. If the phase has a Manual Testing Checklist, add any new checks
4. Update "Last Updated" in the file header
