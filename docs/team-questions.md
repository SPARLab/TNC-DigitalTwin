# Team Questions Log

Use this file as a running backlog of questions to ask the team during reviews or standups.
Goal: batch questions, avoid interrupting people one-by-one, and keep answers in one place.

## How To Use

- Add new questions to the "Open Questions" table.
- Move items to "Answered Questions" once resolved.
- Keep wording concise and decision-focused.

## Open Questions

| ID | Date Added | Area | Question | Why It Matters | Priority | Status |
|----|------------|------|----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Q-001 | 2026-02-16 | ANiML Map Icons | Do you like the current camera trap map icons? If not, what icon style should we use instead (shape, stroke weight, fill, color, badge style)? | We just migrated from emoji to SVG. Team preference now will prevent churn later. | High | Open |

## Answered Questions
