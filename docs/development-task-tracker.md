### 🟡 Remaining (Phase 0)

- [x] **0.4** Map Container — Replace placeholder with ArcGIS WebMap integration
  - Reference: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION/phases/phase-0-foundation.md` Task 0.4
  - ~~Current: Placeholder div with "ArcGIS Map" text~~
  - **Completed (Feb 12):** Real ArcGIS JS API 4.28 WebMap, GraphicsLayers per data source, z-order control
  - **Architecture:** Data source adapter pattern — layers added when pinned OR active

- [x] **Data Source Adapter Pattern Refactor** (Task 23)
  - **Completed (Feb 12):** Extract all data-source-specific logic into plugin system
  - **Files Created:** `src/v2/dataSources/{types.ts, registry.ts, inaturalist/{adapter.tsx, useMapBehavior.ts}}`
  - **Files Modified:** `INaturalistFilterContext.tsx` (lazy cache), `useMapLayers.ts` (generic), `MapContainer.tsx` (generic), `RightSidebar.tsx` (generic), `LayerContext.tsx` (removed iNat from initial pinned)
  - **Lazy Caching:** `warmCache()` idempotent method — fetch on first pin/activation (~2s), instant on revisit
  - **Active Layer Visibility:** Active-but-not-pinned layers now visible on map (DFT-021)
  - **Merge Conflict Surface:** ~4 one-liners per new data source (registry.ts)
  - **Enables:** Safe parallel branch development for Phases 1-4

- [x] **0.5** Drag-and-Drop Reorder — Implement drag handles for pinned layers
  - Reference: `docs/PLANNING/component-specs/map-layers-widget.md` DFT-034
  - Completed: Drag-and-drop reordering implemented within Map Layers widget
  - Implementation: `@dnd-kit/core` integration with visual feedback

- [ ] **0.6** Map Feature Highlight — Hover/view-on-map → highlight on map
  - Reference: DFT-036 (adapted — no longer tied to Saved Items widget)
  - Current: Basic highlight implemented for iNaturalist view-on-map
  - Needed: Cyan ring highlight for all data sources, off-screen indicator, keyboard support

- [ ] **0.9** Dynamic Layer Registry from Data Catalog Service **(CRITICAL — BLOCKS ALL PARALLEL BRANCHES)**
  - **Discovery (Feb 12):** Dan's Data Catalog FeatureServer contains metadata for ~90+ real datasets with hierarchical categories, service URLs, and display titles. This replaces the static `layerRegistry.ts` (27 hardcoded placeholders) with the real catalog.
  - **Service URL:** `https://dangermondpreserve-spatial.com/server/rest/services/Dangermond_Preserve_Data_Catalog/FeatureServer`
  - **Service Structure:**
    - Table 0: Categories (id, name, parent_id for hierarchy, display_order)
    - Table 1: Datasets (id, service_name, display_title, server_base_url, service_path, has_feature_server/map_server/image_server, is_visible)
    - Table 2: Dataset Categories (junction table: dataset_id ↔ category_id, supports many-to-many)
  - **Dendra Sensors: 10 per-type feature services discovered:**
    - Dataloggers, Barometers, Wind Monitors, Weather Stations (all-in-one), Water Level Meters, Solinst Leveloggers, RanchBot Water Monitors, RanchBot Rain Gauges, Rain Gages, Pressure Level Sensors
    - Each follows identical 3-part schema: Layer 0 (Locations), Table 1 (Data), Table 2 (Summary)
    - All on `dangermondpreserve-spatial.com/server/rest/services/`
  - **Other notable datasets:** Camera Trap Data, CalFlora Plant Obs, GBIF Species Occurrences, MOTUS Wildlife Telemetry
  - **Implementation:**
    1. Create `useCatalogRegistry` hook — fetches Categories + Datasets + junction from Data Catalog on app load
    2. Replace static `CATEGORIES` / `LAYERS` arrays with fetched data, mapped to `CatalogLayer[]` / `Category[]`
    3. Map `dataSource` field based on service pattern detection (Dendra sensor → `'dendra'`, iNaturalist → `'inaturalist'`, etc.)
    4. Add "Not Yet Implemented" toast when user activates a layer without an adapter
    5. Preserve existing `LAYER_MAP` / `getAdapter()` lookup pattern — adapters still registered statically
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] Left sidebar shows all ~90+ datasets from Data Catalog, grouped by real categories
    - [ ] Category counts reflect real dataset counts
    - [ ] Categories with subcategories show nested hierarchy
    - [ ] Layers with adapters (iNaturalist) work as before (sidebar, map, legend)
    - [ ] Layers without adapters show informational toast: "This layer is coming soon"
    - [ ] Loading state while catalog fetches
  - **Must merge to main before any parallel branch continues**
  - Files: `src/v2/data/layerRegistry.ts` (refactor), `src/v2/hooks/useCatalogRegistry.ts` (new), `src/v2/components/MapArea/` (toast)

- [x] **0.8** Refine Tree Connectors — Polish L-shaped connectors for nested child views
  - Reference: `docs/PLANNING/component-specs/map-layers-widget.md` (Connecting Line section)
  - Completed: Fixed gaps in tree connectors by extending lines into `space-y-1` gaps (4px) between child rows
  - Implementation: Used CSS borders for seamless L-shape corners, extended vertical lines with `calc(50% + 4px)` to bridge gaps
  - Files: `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`

- [x] ~~**Add Hierarchical Tree Connectors to Saved Items Widget**~~ **(DROPPED: DFT-046 — Saved Items widget disabled, Feb 11)**
  - Was completed but widget is now disabled. CSS animations preserved for future reuse.
  - Files: `BookmarkRow.tsx`, `LayerGroupHeader.tsx`, `BookmarkedItemsWidget.tsx` (preserved, not deleted)

### 🔧 Ad-Hoc Tasks (Phase 0)

- [x] **Fix Map Layers Widget Horizontal Scrollbar** — Ensure widget width accommodates all content
  - Completed: User fixed horizontal scrollbar issue by removing `overflow-y-auto` from map-layers-body div
  - Files: `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/MapLayersWidget.tsx`

- [x] **Fix Nested Layer Expand/Collapse** — Make Camera Traps child views collapsible
  - Completed: Added `isExpanded` check to nested child views rendering
  - Added: Smooth bidirectional animations using CSS Grid technique (grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr)
  - Implementation: Elements stay in DOM with grid + opacity transitions for smooth expand/collapse in both directions
  - Timing: 300ms ease-in-out for all expand/collapse, 200ms for chevron rotation and hover states
  - Fixed: React type imports (MouseEvent → ReactMouseEvent, KeyboardEvent → ReactKeyboardEvent)
  - Files: `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `MapLayersWidget.tsx`, `ActiveLayerSection.tsx`, `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`, `FilterIndicator.tsx`, `LayerRow.tsx`, `LucideIcon.tsx`
  - Behavior: Click Camera Traps row or widget collapse button to see smooth height/opacity animations

- [x] **Add Rounded Bottom Corners to Collapsed Widgets** — Polish widget header appearance when collapsed
  - Completed: Header now conditionally applies `rounded-xl` (all corners) when collapsed, `rounded-t-xl + border-b` when expanded
  - Files: `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/shared/WidgetHeader.tsx`
  - Applies to: Both Map Layers and Bookmarked Items widgets

- [x] **Enable Map Layers Drag Reordering** — Make pinned layers draggable to change order
  - Completed: Drag-and-drop reordering implemented within Map Layers widget
  - Files: `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayersSection.tsx`
  - Consolidated with Task 0.5

- [x] **Make Filter Icons Clickable for Child Views** — Show filter queries when clicking filter indicator
  - Completed: Child row click expands to show filter clauses (split on comma). Filter icon or "Edit Filters" navigates to right sidebar Browse tab. One child expanded at a time. LayerContext: toggleChildVisibility, clearFilters, requestEditFilters. Flat rows also use multi-clause display.
  - Updated (Feb 9): Filter icon now expands row (no stopPropagation); "Edit Filters" button in expanded panel opens Browse tab.
  - Files: `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayersSection.tsx`, `MapLayersWidget.tsx`, `LayerContext.tsx`, `RightSidebar.tsx`, `types/index.ts`

- [x] **Multi-View Management for Pinned Layers** — Create and remove filtered views
  - Completed: Added "+ New View" button in flat expanded filter panel to convert flat→nested structure. Creates two views: current filters become "View 1" (or uses distinguisher name), new empty "View 2". Added "X" button to remove individual child views. Smart conversion: removing views to leave only 1 converts back to flat, preserving last view's state as distinguisher.
  - Implementation: `createNewView(pinnedId)` and `removeView(pinnedId, viewId)` in LayerContext. Wired through MapLayersWidget → PinnedLayersSection → PinnedLayerRow → PinnedLayerChildRow.
  - Files: `LayerContext.tsx`, `MapLayersWidget.tsx`, `PinnedLayersSection.tsx`, `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`

- [x] **Reorganize Filter Panel Layout** — Optimize spacing and button placement
  - Completed: Reorganized both flat and child filter panels for clarity. Top section: filter summary (left) + "Clear" button (top right). Bottom section: flat has "+ New View" (left) + "Edit Filters >" (right); child has "Edit Filters >" (right only). Removed unnecessary whitespace while maintaining readability.
  - Files: `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`

- [x] **Consolidate Filter Details in Layer Containers** — Move filter details inside expandable layer boxes (Feb 10)
  - Completed: Filter details (species, date, confidence, Clear, Edit Filters) now live inside the same yellow/amber container as the layer row. Added light gray divider between collapsed row and expanded details. Eliminates visual disconnect of separate gray boxes. "+ New View" remains inside expanded parent container.
  - Files: `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`

- [x] **Meaningful Default View Names** — Replace "View 1/2/3" with action-oriented labels (Feb 10)
  - Completed: New empty views named "Add Filters". Initial view uses distinguisher, "Filtered View", or "Default View" as appropriate. Improves recognition over recall (Nielsen).
  - Files: `LayerContext.tsx`

- [x] **Differentiate "Add Filters" Placeholder Views** — Visual signifier for empty views (Feb 10)
  - Completed: "Add Filters" views display dashed border to indicate empty/placeholder state. Removed container opacity for non-visible views; text now consistently `text-gray-800` for readability across all states.
  - Files: `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`

- [x] **Smooth CSS Transitions for Map Layers Widget** — Polish Active Layer and Pinned Layer animations (Feb 10)
  - Completed: Added smooth slide-up/fade-out when Active Layer section disappears (pinned). Added slide-down entrance animation for newly pinned layers (no opacity change, pure vertical motion). Both animations 300-400ms ease-out with reduced-motion support.
  - Implementation: Snapshot state pattern in MapLayersWidget preserves Active Layer data during 300ms exit transition. PinnedLayersSection detects new layer additions and triggers 400ms slide-down from -8px above final position.
  - Files: `MapLayersWidget.tsx`, `ActiveLayerSection.tsx`, `PinnedLayersSection.tsx`, `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `index.css`
  - Result: Smooth coordinated animations as layers transition from Active → Pinned state

- [x] **Refine Active Layer → Pinned Layer Transition** — Further polish for the transition when pinning
  - Done: Removed flash; newly pinned row now slides down from under the Pinned Layers header while the section expands (wrapper animates max-height 0→280px, row animates translateY(-100%)→0). Single 400ms ease-out; reduced-motion respected.
  - Implementation: `pin-row-expand` + `slide-down-from-above` in `index.css`; `PinnedLayersSection` wraps justPinned row in expanding wrapper; `PinnedLayerRow` uses `animate-slide-down-from-above`.
  - Optional later: Even tighter choreography with Active Layer exit (e.g. shared easing or position handoff).
  - Files: `MapLayersWidget.tsx`, `PinnedLayersSection.tsx`, `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `index.css`

- [x] **Prevent Map Layers Widget Scrollbar from Pushing Content** — Scrollbar should not reduce content width
  - Completed: Scrollbar overlays or reserves space; content width stays stable within Map Layers widget
  - Files: `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/MapLayersWidget.tsx`, `map-layers-body` / scroll container structure

- [x] **Fix Tree Connector Lines Between Parent and Child Rows** — Ensure continuous visual connection in nested layer hierarchy
  - Completed: Moved connector elements from inside `.nested-child` to outer wrapper so they span full height including expanded filter panels. Vertical continuation uses `bottom: -4px` for dynamic height. All connectors standardized to `1px solid #d1d5db`. Parent stub height increased from 8px to 12px for solid overlap.
  - Files: `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`

- [x] **Remove Gray Divider in Left Sidebar** — Remove separator between normal layers and DataOne datasets
  - Completed: Removed gray horizontal divider (`border-t border-gray-200`) between DataOne shortcut and regular layers
  - Preserved: Italics styling for DataOne row
  - Files: `src/v2/components/LeftSidebar/CategoryGroup.tsx`

- [x] **Fix Map Layers Widget Drag Animation** — Restore smooth drag-and-drop animations
  - Problem: When dragging a layer down, the layer underneath performed an upward transform, then disappeared. Animations were previously smooth but broke after updates.
  - Root Cause: `@dnd-kit/sortable` by default animates layout changes for all items during drag operations, causing non-dragged items to perform jarring transforms.
  - Solution: Disabled automatic layout animations by passing `animateLayoutChanges: () => false` to the `useSortable` hook in `PinnedLayerRow`.
  - Result: Smooth drag animations restored. Only the dragged item transforms; other items remain stable during drag.
  - Files: `src/v2/components/FloatingWidgets/MapLayersWidget/PinnedLayerRow.tsx`

- [x] **Fix DataOne Datasets Card Width in Left Sidebar** — Match DataOne shortcut row width with regular layer cards
  - Completed: Added `w-full` to DataOne shortcut button and LayerRow for consistent full-width behavior; increased parent right margin (`mr-2` → `mr-3`) for proper edge spacing; removed redundant left vertical border (`border-l-2 border-gray-200`) that added visual noise (background color + indentation already establish hierarchy)
  - Files: `src/v2/components/LeftSidebar/CategoryGroup.tsx`, `src/v2/components/LeftSidebar/LayerRow.tsx`

- [x] **Active Layer Click Interactions** — Clicking layers activates them and shows in right sidebar
  - Completed: Clicking pinned layer activates it, expands panel, and collapses others (accordion pattern)
  - Clicking child view activates it and makes it visible (mutual exclusivity maintained)
  - Clicking non-pinned layer collapses all pinned panels
  - Active state changed from emerald to amber highlighting (parent + active child both amber)
  - Eye icons changed to gray scheme (dark gray visible, light gray hidden)
  - Parent eye toggle controls all children (hide all when off, restore when on)
  - Auto-collapse via useEffect ensures only one panel open at a time
  - Files: `PinnedLayerRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx`, `PinnedLayersSection.tsx`, `LayerContext.tsx`, `MapLayersWidget.tsx`
  - Result: Clear interaction model where "active = inspecting = expanded = amber"

- [x] **Left Sidebar: Visual Distinction Between Categories and Layers** — Improve hierarchy perception
  - Goal: Clearly differentiate categories from their child layers in the left sidebar
  - Add backgrounds around category groups so dropdown content feels nested
  - Use indentation + distinct highlight treatments for layers vs categories
  - Layers should read as conceptually subordinate to categories (parent-child hierarchy)
  - Addresses: Low visual distinction between category and layer rows when expanded
  - Completed: Category banners (slate-100), Research Datasets moved to bottom with darker gray bg (gray-200), no bottom border; layer cards with amber active state, blue pins
  - Files: `src/v2/components/LeftSidebar/` (CategoryGroup, LayerRow, etc.), `src/v2/data/layerRegistry.ts`

- [ ] **Right Sidebar: Active Layer Color Coordination & Flash** — Unify active semantics and feedback
  - Header: Add yellow background to right sidebar header (match mapped item layers active indicator)
  - Left sidebar: Change active layer highlight from green to yellow to sync with Map Layers widget
  - Rationale: Green (left) vs yellow (mapped items) creates confusion; unify on yellow
  - Flash/animation: When active layer changes, right sidebar header flashes (white → yellow) so eyes quickly register "right sidebar changed"
  - Mapped item layers widget: Consider animation when layers change (e.g. subtle transition) to reinforce "inspecting different layer"
  - Goal: User immediately perceives that clicking a different item layer = inspecting different content
  - Files: `src/v2/components/RightSidebar/`, `LeftSidebar/`, `MapLayersWidget/`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete Phase 0)

1. **ArcGIS Map Integration** (Task 0.4)
   - Install `@arcgis/core` (already in package.json)
   - Create `MapContainer` with WebMap
   - Wire up GraphicsLayers for pinned layers
   - Sync z-order with widget drag-reorder

2. **Test Core Interactions**
   - Verify pin/unpin syncs between sidebar ↔ widget
   - Verify eye toggle syncs bidirectionally
   - Verify undo stack works (max 5 actions)
   - Verify search filters correctly

### After Phase 0 (Phase 1-4)

- **Phase 1:** iNaturalist data source — 9 active tasks

  - [x] **Task 13: Fix iNaturalist Layer Icons & Loading** ✅
    - **Completed:** Replaced FeatureLayer (no spatial filter, loaded all US data) with GraphicsLayer populated from locally-cached observations (expanded preserve bounding box). Legend counts computed locally (eliminated 11 API calls). Instant taxon filtering. Layer starts hidden.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistFilterContext.tsx`, `inaturalistLayer.ts`, `useMapLayers.ts`, `INaturalistLegendWidget.tsx`, `useINaturalistObservations.ts`, `LayerContext.tsx`, `MapContainer.tsx`

  - [ ] **Task 14: Observation Card Click → Map Highlight + Detail View**
    - **Goal:** Clicking an observation card in Browse tab should (1) highlight the corresponding map marker with cyan ring + tooltip, (2) zoom map to observation, (3) navigate to detail view in right sidebar.
    - **Implementation:** Wire `onViewDetail` in `ObservationCard` to call `highlightPoint()` + `view.goTo()` from MapContext, then transition Browse tab to detail view state.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`, `ObservationCard.tsx`, `MapContext.tsx`

  - [ ] **Task 15: Map Marker Click → Zoom + Detail View**
    - **Goal:** Clicking an iNaturalist map marker (emoji icon) should zoom to the observation and open its detail view in the right sidebar.
    - **Implementation:** Add popupTemplate click handler or graphic click event listener in `inaturalistLayer.ts`. Trigger `activateLayer()` with observation ID, pass to Browse tab to show detail view.
    - **Files:** `inaturalistLayer.ts`, `LayerContext.tsx`, `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`
    - **Note:** May require passing observation ID through active layer state or MapContext event bus.

  - [ ] **Task 16: Remove Bookmark Button/Action**
    - **Goal:** Clean up unused bookmark logic from observation cards and detail view (already stubbed as TODO).
    - **Implementation:** Remove "Bookmark" button from `ObservationCard` and `INaturalistDetailView`. Remove `handleBookmark` stub functions.
    - **Files:** `ObservationCard.tsx`, `INaturalistDetailView.tsx`, `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`

  - [ ] **Task 17: Compact Filter Section (Dropdown)**
    - **Goal:** Filter Observations section in Browse tab is too tall (12 checkboxes). Convert to a dropdown menu with multi-select checkboxes inside. Include "Select All" option.
    - **Implementation:** Replace checkbox list with a `<select>` or custom dropdown component. Show selected count badge (e.g., "3 taxa selected"). Expand to show checkboxes on click.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`
    - **Design:** Match filter dropdown pattern from other data sources (ANiML, Dendra).

  - [ ] **Task 18: Rename Legend Widget Title**
    - **Goal:** Change floating legend header from "Filter Observations" to "iNaturalist Taxa" (more descriptive, avoids confusion with Browse tab filter section).
    - **Implementation:** Update `<h3>` text in `INaturalistLegendWidget.tsx`.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistLegendWidget.tsx`

  - [ ] **Task 19: Add Observation Search Bar**
    - **Goal:** Add a search input in Browse tab to filter observations by common name or scientific name (client-side substring match).
    - **Implementation:** Add text input above filter section. Filter `allObservations` in `useINaturalistObservations` by search term. Reset page to 1 on search change.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`, `useINaturalistObservations.ts`

  - [ ] **Task 20: Reduce Pagination to 10 per Page**
    - **Goal:** Show 10 observations per page instead of 20 in Browse tab (better vertical scrolling UX).
    - **Implementation:** Change `PAGE_SIZE` from 20 → 10 in `useINaturalistObservations.ts`.
    - **Files:** `useINaturalistObservations.ts`

  - [ ] **Task 21: Add Date Range Filter**
    - **Goal:** Add start/end date pickers in Browse tab filter section to filter observations by `observed_on` date.
    - **Implementation:** Add two `<input type="date">` fields. Pass `startDate`/`endDate` to `useINaturalistObservations`. Filter observations client-side by date range.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`, `useINaturalistObservations.ts`

  - [ ] **Task 22: Remember Last Active Tab**
    - **Goal:** When user switches away from iNaturalist and returns, restore the last active tab (Overview or Browse) instead of always resetting to Overview.
    - **Implementation:** Store `lastActiveTab` per layer ID in a ref or local state map. Restore on layer reactivation. Consider using `LayerContext` or a new `lastTabByLayer` map in `RightSidebar`.
    - **Files:** `RightSidebar.tsx`, `LayerContext.tsx`

  - [ ] **Future/Low Priority: Save Observation → Create Filtered View**
    - **Goal:** Clicking "Save" on an observation creates a new child view in Map Layers widget filtered to that specific observation (by ID or name).
    - **Implementation:** Wire "Save" action to `createNewView(pinnedId)` in LayerContext. Set filter to `observation_id = {id}`. Complex — requires linking browse actions to Map Layers state.
    - **Priority:** Deferred — low user value, high complexity.
    - **Files:** `INaturalistBrowseTab.tsx`, `LayerContext.tsx`, `inaturalistLayer.ts`

- **Phase 2:** ANiML data source

  - [x] **Tasks 2.3–2.6: Multi-dimensional filter system** ✅
    - **Completed (Feb 13):** FilterSection.tsx (expandable, multi-select, Select All/Clear All). AnimlFilterContext: selectedCameras, toggleCamera, clearCameras, selectAllAnimals, selectAllCameras, filteredImageCount, getFilteredCountForSpecies. AnimlBrowseTab: Species + Cameras FilterSections, live result count, debounced image fetch, ImageList. Researchers can select multiple species AND cameras.
    - **Files:** `FilterSection.tsx`, `AnimlFilterContext.tsx`, `AnimlBrowseTab.tsx`

  - [ ] **Task 2.10: Right Sidebar Scrollbar — Prevent content shift**
    - **Goal:** When right sidebar content grows (selecting species + camera), scrollbar appears. Content should NOT shift left. Use `scrollbar-gutter: stable` or overlay scrollbar.
    - **Files:** `src/v2/components/RightSidebar/RightSidebar.tsx`

  - [ ] **Task 2.11: Date/Time Frame Filter — Above Species and Cameras**
    - **Goal:** Add date range query UI above Species and Cameras in Browse tab. Enables "mountain lions at cameras A,B,C in summer 2023" queries.
    - **Files:** `AnimlFilterContext.tsx`, `AnimlBrowseTab.tsx`, `animlService.ts`
- **Phase 3:** Dendra data source (6 tasks)
- **Phase 4:** DataOne data source (5 tasks)

See `docs/master-plan.md` for full phase breakdown.

## Change Log

| Date | Phase | Change | By |
|------|-------|--------|-----|
| Feb 13, 2026 | Phase 2 | ✅ **Tasks 2.3–2.6 complete: ANiML Browse tab multi-dimensional filter system.** FilterSection.tsx (expandable, multi-select, Select All/Clear All). AnimlFilterContext: selectedCameras, toggleCamera, clearCameras, selectAllAnimals, selectAllCameras, filteredImageCount. AnimlBrowseTab: Species + Cameras FilterSections, live result count, debounced image fetch, ImageList. Researchers can select multiple species AND cameras. Added Tasks 2.10 (right sidebar scrollbar — prevent content shift) and 2.11 (date/time frame filter above Species and Cameras). | Claude |
| Feb 12, 2026 | Phase 0 | 🟡 **Task 24 (0.9): Dynamic Layer Registry from Data Catalog Service.** Discovered Dan's Data Catalog FeatureServer with ~90+ real datasets, 14 categories (with subcategories), and 10 per-type Dendra sensor services. All sensor services follow identical 3-part schema (Locations/Data/Summary). Replaces static layerRegistry.ts. **All parallel branches paused until complete.** | Claude |
| Feb 12, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ **Task 23 complete: Data Source Adapter Pattern refactor.** Created plugin architecture: each data source implements `DataSourceAdapter` interface. Core files (MapContainer, RightSidebar, useMapLayers) made data-source-agnostic — read from registry. Lazy caching: `warmCache()` pattern (iNat: 2.18s initial, instant revisit). Active-but-not-pinned layers visible on map. Files: `dataSources/{types.ts, registry.ts, inaturalist/{adapter.tsx, useMapBehavior.ts}}`. Modified: INaturalistFilterContext (lazy), useMapLayers (generic), MapContainer/RightSidebar (generic), LayerContext (removed iNat from initial). Merge conflicts: ~4 lines/source. **Enables parallel branch development.** | Claude |
| Feb 12, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ **Task 1 complete: ArcGIS Map Integration (0.4).** Replaced placeholder with real ArcGIS WebMap. Layers added when pinned OR active. GraphicsLayer for highlights. | Claude |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Phase 1 | Added **Tasks 14-22** for iNaturalist UX improvements: map marker interactions, compact filter dropdown, search bar, date filter, pagination (10/page), tab memory, legend rename. Future: save observation → filtered view (low priority). | Claude |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Phase 1 | ✅ **Task 13 complete: Fix iNaturalist Layer Icons & Loading.** Replaced FeatureLayer with spatially-filtered GraphicsLayer; local counts; instant filtering; starts hidden. | Claude |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Phase 1 | Added **Task 13: Fix iNaturalist Layer Icons & Loading** — Wrong/fake icons before active; delay on layer click; slow taxa filter in legend. WIP commit. | User |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ **DFT-046: Saved Items widget dropped.** Unified into Map Layers. "Mapped Item Layers" renamed to "Map Layers". BookmarkProvider/BookmarkedItemsWidget disabled (code preserved). Bookmark actions in iNaturalist stubbed as TODO ("Save as View"). All documentation updated. | Claude |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 12 complete: Fix DataOne Datasets Card Width. Added w-full to DataOne shortcut and LayerRow; mr-3 for right padding; removed redundant left border from category content (background + indentation sufficient for hierarchy). | Claude |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Saved Items hierarchical tree connectors complete: Added L-shaped tree lines, emerald left border accent, full-width boxed headers, dynamic height (50vh cap), stub connector from headers. Distinguishes saved items (left border) from Map Layers child views (full boxes). | Claude |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | Added tasks 10 & 11: Left Sidebar visual distinction (categories vs layers); Right Sidebar color coordination (yellow header, active layer sync, flash on change). | User |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 8 complete: Refine Active Layer → Pinned Layer Transition. Newly pinned row slides down from under header; section expands; no flash. | User |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 7 complete: Remove Gray Divider in Left Sidebar. Removed border-t between DataOne shortcut and regular layers; italics preserved. | User |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 2 & 5 complete: Drag-and-Drop Reorder for pinned layers (Map Layers widget); Prevent Map Layers Widget Scrollbar from Pushing Content. Both done within Map Layers widget. | User |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Smooth CSS Transitions for Map Layers Widget: Active Layer section slides up/fades out on pin (300ms). New pinned layers slide down from above (400ms, no opacity). Snapshot state pattern for exit animation. Reduced-motion support. | Claude |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Map Layers UX polish: Consolidated filter details inside layer containers (no separate gray boxes); added "Add Filters" naming for new views; dashed border for placeholder views; removed opacity so non-selected text stays readable (text-gray-800). | Composer |
| Feb 9, 2026 (eve) | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 4 complete: Unify Map Layers Expansion Affordances. Removed chevrons; filter icon is now primary expansion control. Parent shows visible child's filter count. Child rows use accordion pattern (one expanded at a time). Auto-activate + auto-expand visible child when pinned layer clicked from sidebar. User can manually collapse active layers without forced re-expansion. | Claude |
| Feb 9, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 6 complete: Fix Tree Connector Lines Between Parent and Child Rows. Moved connectors to outer wrapper for full-height coverage including expanded filter panels; standardized 1px solid #d1d5db; parent stub 12px. | Claude |
| Feb 9, 2026 | Phase 0 | Added task: Prevent Map Layers Widget Scrollbar from Pushing Content — vertical scrollbar compresses content when child filter panels expand; fix so scrollbar overlays or reserves stable space. | Claude |
| Feb 9, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 4 complete: Make Filter Icons Clickable for Child Views. Child row click expands filter clauses (split on comma). Edit Filters / filter icon opens Browse tab. One child expanded at a time. Added toggleChildVisibility, clearFilters, requestEditFilters to LayerContext. | Claude |
| Feb 9, 2026 | Phase 0 | ✅ Task 0.8 complete: Fixed tree connector gaps by extending lines into spacing gaps. Used CSS borders for seamless L-shape corners. | Claude |
| Feb 7, 2026 | Phase 0 | WIP: Multi-view nested structure, tree connectors (L-shaped), pin-to-top behavior, smooth animations. New components: PinnedLayerChildRow, NewViewButton. Card styling restored. Commit: 4fd430e | Claude |
| Feb 6, 2026 | Phase 0 | Built core shell: left sidebar, map layers widget, bookmarked items widget, right sidebar shell, state management. 27 files, 1,748 lines. Zero TypeScript/linter errors. | Opus |
| Feb 6, 2026 | Phase 0 | Added v1/v2 toggle via `?v2` URL param. "Try v2.0" button in legacy header. | Opus |

## Recent Work Summary (Feb 9, 2026 PM)

### Multi-View Management for Pinned Layers
- **Feature**: Create and remove filtered views for pinned layers
- **"+ New View" Button**: Converts flat (single view) → nested (multi-view) structure. Creates 2 views: current filters become View 1 (uses distinguisher name like "Mar 2024" if available), new empty View 2.
- **"X" Remove Button**: Removes individual child views. Smart conversion: when only 1 view remains, converts back to flat structure preserving last view's state.
- **Implementation**: Added `createNewView(pinnedId)` and `removeView(pinnedId, viewId)` to LayerContext. Wired through: MapLayersWidget → PinnedLayersSection → PinnedLayerRow → PinnedLayerChildRow.
- **Files**: LayerContext.tsx, MapLayersWidget.tsx, PinnedLayersSection.tsx, PinnedLayerRow.tsx, PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx

### Filter Panel Layout Reorganization
- **Layout Changes**:
  - Top: Filter summary (left) + "Clear" button (top right)
  - Bottom: "+ New View" (left, flat only) + "Edit Filters >" (right)
  - Child panels: Just "Edit Filters >" (right-aligned)
- **Optimization**: Removed unnecessary whitespace for more compact presentation
- **Files**: PinnedLayerRow.tsx, PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx

### Filter Icon Behavior Update
- **Change**: Clicking filter icon on child views now expands/collapses row (instead of triggering Edit Filters)
- **Rationale**: More intuitive - icon shows filter count, clicking shows filters; "Edit Filters" button in expanded panel opens Browse tab
- **Files**: PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx

### Active Layer Interaction System (Feb 9, 2026 PM)
- **Feature**: Comprehensive click interaction overhaul for active layer management
- **Clicking Layers**:
  - Click parent layer → activates visible child + expands panel + collapses all others (accordion)
  - Click child view → activates it + makes visible + hides siblings (mutual exclusivity)
  - Click non-pinned layer → collapses all pinned panels
  - Active layer section hides when pinned layer is active (no duplication)
- **Visual Changes**:
  - Active state changed from emerald to amber highlighting
  - Parent and active child both get amber background/border
  - Eye icons changed to gray (dark gray visible, light gray hidden)
  - Removed all emerald backgrounds
- **Interaction Improvements**:
  - Parent eye toggle controls all children (hide all when off, restore first visible when on)
  - Clicking child view makes it visible and active simultaneously
  - Auto-collapse ensures only one panel open at a time (focused UX)
  - useEffect syncs expansion state with active layer changes
- **Result**: Clear mental model where "active = inspecting = expanded = amber"
- **Files**: PinnedLayerRow.tsx, PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx, PinnedLayersSection.tsx, LayerContext.tsx, MapLayersWidget.tsx

### Unified Expansion Affordances (Feb 9, 2026 Evening)
- **Feature**: Consolidated expansion controls and improved child view interactions
- **Chevron Removal**: Replaced chevron (>) with filter icon as primary expansion affordance
  - Filter icon semantically matches action (expand to see filters)
  - Simpler visual pattern — one icon, one purpose
- **Parent Filter Count Sync**: Parent row filter count now matches visible child's count
  - Dynamic: changes when switching between child views
  - Provides at-a-glance info about active filters
- **Child Row Accordion**: Only one child expanded at a time within same parent
  - Prevents cognitive overload from multiple expanded panels
  - Helps user track focus
  - State managed by parent component (PinnedLayerRow)
- **Auto-Expand from Sidebar**:
  - Clicking pinned layer from left sidebar → parent expands
  - Visible child view auto-activates (amber highlight)
  - Active child's filter panel auto-expands showing filter details
- **User Control**: Users can manually collapse active layers
  - Prevents forced re-expansion on re-click
  - Tracks `lastActiveLayerId` to only auto-expand on first activation
  - Respects user intent to keep things collapsed
- **Files**: FilterIndicator.tsx, PinnedLayerRow.tsx, PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx, PinnedLayersSection.tsx
- **Status**: Map Layers widget considered complete for Phase 0

### Map Layers UX Polish (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Filter Panel Consolidation**: Filter details (species, date, confidence, Clear, Edit Filters) now live inside the same yellow/amber container as the layer row. Added light gray divider between collapsed row and expanded details. Eliminates visual disconnect of separate gray boxes; improves Gestalt proximity.
- **Default View Names**: New empty views named "Add Filters" (action-oriented). Initial view uses distinguisher, "Filtered View", or "Default View". Replaces generic "View 1/2/3".
- **Placeholder Differentiation**: "Add Filters" views display dashed border to signal empty/actionable state.
- **Text Readability**: Removed container opacity for non-visible views; text consistently `text-gray-800` for all states. Visibility communicated via eye icon only.
- **Files**: PinnedLayerChildRow.tsx, PinnedLayerRow.tsx, LayerContext.tsx
