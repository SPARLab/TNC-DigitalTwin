## Internal Use - Response Analysis Template

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Adoption blockers** (Q4): What's preventing usage?
- **Feature priorities** (Q5): What do people actually want?
- **Data gaps** (Q7): What's missing?
- **Usage likelihood** (Q11): Who will actually use this?
- **Current alternatives** (Q12): What are we competing with?

### Follow-up Actions:
- Group responses by role/use case
- Identify patterns in blockers and requests
- Create prioritized feature backlog
- Schedule follow-ups with key users
- Share findings with development team
