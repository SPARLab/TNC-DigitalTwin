# Dangermond Preserve Data Catalog

A modern React TypeScript application for browsing and visualizing environmental research data from the Dangermond Preserve. This application provides an intuitive interface for researchers and scientists to discover, filter, and explore various datasets including wildlife surveys, vegetation analysis, climate data, and hydrological measurements.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Catalog**: Browse through 247+ environmental datasets
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by data category, source, spatial area, and time range
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize data locations with toggleable layers
- **Data-Dense UI**: Optimized for maximum information density on desktop screens
- **Modern UI**: Clean, accessible interface built with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons

## Design System

This application uses a **data-dense design system** optimized for displaying maximum information on desktop screens. The design system is documented in detail at:

📄 **[docs/design-system/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](docs/design-system/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)**

### Key Design Principles

- **Desktop-only**: Minimum supported width is 1024px (screens below show a "Desktop Required" message)
- **Information density**: Smaller fonts and tighter spacing than typical consumer apps
- **Responsive breakpoints**:
  - `lg` (1024–1279px): Compact mode — dense UI, compact cards
  - `xl` (1280–1439px): Standard laptop — balanced density  
  - `2xl` (≥1440px): Desktop — full experience

### Quick Reference

| Element | lg (1024px) | xl (1280px) | 2xl (1440px+) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Body text | 12px | 12px | 13px |
| Card titles | 12px | 13px | 14px |
| Card descriptions | Hidden | 1 line | 2 lines |
| Left sidebar | 240px | 280px | 320px |

For full specifications including typography, spacing, and card modes, see the design system document.

## Data Categories

The catalog includes datasets from four main categories:

- **Wildlife** - Camera trap surveys, species observations
- **Vegetation** - Satellite imagery analysis, plant surveys  
- **Climate** - Weather station data, temperature/precipitation
- **Hydrology** - Stream flow monitoring, water quality
